# hubmetrix-backend
This is the backend for the reference app for the BigCommerce Marketplace. There are two repos for this reference app, mainly b/c it's split into two Zappa projects for easier maintenance.

It appears that zappa.io has gone dark. The project still seems to be maintained, but I would probably choose AWS Chalice for this project now.
